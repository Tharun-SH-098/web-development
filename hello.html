            <h2>About Us</h2>
            
            <p>At first glance, the words “hometown” and “home town” might seem to have different meanings. After all, “hometown” is a closed compound word, while “home town” is an open compound word. However, they have more in common than not.

                “Hometown” is the correct spelling in American English, while “home town” is generally the correct spelling in British English. “Hometown” and “home town” can both function as stand-alone or attributive nouns, and they refer to the place where someone was born, raised, or now lives.
                
                This is one example of how we can write some words in English, whether American or British, as one compound word or two separate words that come together to form a single meaning.</p>
